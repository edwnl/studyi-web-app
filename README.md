Studyi was developed as my highschool project in 2021. It aimed to supercharge studying using the forgetting curve. (Image Credit: growthengineering.co.uk)

In Studyi, tasks are created and revised through a responsive web app. Created tasks will be due for revision in 24 hours, 3 days and finally 7 days.
